Broda Otto Barnes (14 April 1906 â€“ 1 November 1988) was an American physician and professor of medicine who studied endocrine dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism.[4][5] In the 1970s, Barnes published several books arguing that hypothyroidism was underdiagnosed in the U.S. and was responsible for a wide range of health problems. Barnes' views on the prevalence of hypothyroidism were never widely accepted by the medical community and run counter to its current understanding of thyroid function, but they have been embraced by some elements of the alternative medicine community.[6]
